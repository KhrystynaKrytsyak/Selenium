Handling multiple windows (tabs):

- In order ro handle multiple windows we will be using:
1. getWindowHandle();
2. getWindowHandles();


WindowHandle:
- is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or a tab
- it is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID

the original page where you navigate will be called parent handle
and additional tab opened afterwards will be called child handle

---> Most of the time when you interact with links they will open a new tab or a window.

 in this case we are bringing out script and page load to the same speed level.
