Selenium Class 6

                        Alerts
Alert is a pop up message. Alerts take a complete focus of pur main page that we are on. We cannot proceed further until
its handled.

There are 3 types of alerts:
1. Web Based alerts/HTML Alerts ---> we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2. Javascript Alert/ browser alert ---> we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                        we cannot inspect
3. Windows base alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium -- not windows OS, it is a window window

Types of JavaScript alerts:
1. simple alert - click on
2. confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3. prompt alert - enter the text and then click ok or cancel

How to handle these JS Alerts?
There are 4 methods:
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click on cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()


FRAME:
---> its a separate independent window in out web page
---> frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page
3 ways to interact or to switch to a frame
1. by index
2. by name or id
3. by webelement

in alerts ---> switch to an alert manually and it gets switched back automatically
in frames ---> switch to frame manually and switch back to the main page manually
